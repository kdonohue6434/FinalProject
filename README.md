This project was created to demonstrate the concept of gatekeeping in technology. This concept is displayed in the game by going through  a story about user who recently switched to Iphone from an android phone. Through the game it is displayed how the apple products are gatekeeping their users away from certain prodcuts that they were able to use on their android devices that they will no longer be able to use on their Iphone. This demonstrates the concept of gatekeeping as it is when a company controls access to resources and technologies from other companies keeping the user to only their products.
